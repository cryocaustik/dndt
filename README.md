## About DnDT

DnDT - Dungeons and Dragons Tracker, is a simple tracking tool to help track various things across campaigns.

While application originated with the goal of tracking a shared inventory, I do hope to expand it to tracking shared contacts, locations, and maybe documents/notes.

### Inventory Tracking

Tracking inventories in DnDT is designed to give a historical log of items coming in and out, while still giving users a simple summary and ability to filter the history by varying elements.


## Powered By 

The application is built on Laravel as the backend, which serves up VueJS as the front end, creating a nimble and extensible experience.

Backend:

- [Laravel v8.x](https://laravel.com/)
- [Sanctum (session based authentication)](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sanctum)
- [Socialite (third party SSO)](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/socialite)

Frontend:

- [VueJS v2.x](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vuetify (UI library)](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)
- [Axios (http requests FE to BE)](https://github.com/axios/axios)

## Contributing

I am an amatuer with both, Laravel and VueJS and I am sure there are a lot of areas to improve on. If you would like to contribute to improve/fix/expand DnDT, feel free to open a PR.

Please keep in mind that the application is still in development and NOT in stable release.
